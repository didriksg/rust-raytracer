# Raytracing in a Weekend - In Rust
A simple raytracer based on the [_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)
 by Peter Shirley, written in Rust. The raytracer uses the`image` crate to generate the image from a buffer
and `rayon` to add parallelization.
